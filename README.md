# Performance Evaluation of Software RAID versus Hardware RAID for Windows 10 Home

Abstract â€“ RAID storage arrays are an
essential tool in data storage, providing
redundancy and performance increases
while combining multiple hard drives into
one consistent storage pool. As the most
popular desktop OS in the world [5]
Windows 10 is an ideal candidate for
testing configurations of RAID drives for
use by the average consumer.
Software and hardware RAID
configurations were tested in order to
determine which format provided the best
performance for each array configuration.
Single-drive performance was
benchmarked against 4-disk arrays of
RAID level 0, 1, and 5 for both Windows
Storage Spaces and Intel Rapid Storage
Technology on the Z390 chipset.
It was found that Intel Rapid Storage
Technology was on average better than or
comparable to Windows Storage Spaces
for all RAID levels. Intel Rapid Storage
Technology RAID 0 was the best
performing configuration across all
metrics, with the exception of large file
writes, where it was second best.
